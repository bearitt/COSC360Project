Really cool wine game!

Hey guys, have you heard of this new game called Hundred days? It''s awesome, it''s like a winery simulator where you get to grow your own grapes, then make your own wine from them. All the decisions you make affect the quality of the final wine in very realistic ways. It''s being developed by an indie studio in Italy, and a bunch of the devs work in the wine industry!

Dude that''s amazing!
Wine sucks, I only drink Red Bull
Can''t wait to play the game, that sounds so cool!

Amazing Pinot Noir

In my glass tonight: 2016 Spearhead Pinot Noir. Light bodied, very light tannin structure, bright acidity which doesn''t overwhelm the ripe cherry and raspberry fruit. Somehow both floral and herbal on the nose, like cherry blossoms mixed in with wild sage. Highly recommend, 8/10

Spearhead is the best...
Man, they are doing such cool stuff at that winery, way to support the BC wine industry!!

NBA is gonna play horse?

Did anyone else hear about how ESPN wants to broadcast NBA players remotely playing HORSE because of the whole covid thing? Can''t decide if this is pathetic or the best thing ever...

I love horses!!
HORSE has nothing to do with horses, smh...

Connor McDavid, GOAT?

My vote is yes, McJesus FTW, Gretzky is garbage.

You watch your mouth! No one will ever match number 99!!
Pff, you must be from Edmonton. Sidney Crosby is way better than either of them.
Sidney Crosby is a piece of garbage
Your mom is a piece of garbage

DOOM Eternal on Linux?

Anyone tried playing new DOOM on Linux? I just installed Salient OS, I wanna smash some demons!

Possible through Steam Proton, you''ll need some custom configuration though.
What about through Wine?
Also doable, check out the Lutris website for install scripts

Best GTA game?

What do you guys think? My vote is GTA IV

Not a chance! How can you say anything other than GTA V? It''s a masterpiece!
I''m all about San Andreas. That soundtrack was bonkers
You wanna talk bonkers soundtracks, what about Vice City? And I raaaaan, I ran so far awaaaaay!
Just like girls do when they see you, they raaaan, ran so far awaaaaay!
I am a girl you dumbass!

Beatles or Rolling Stones

You know I''m all about that controversy, let''s hear it, who''s better, Beatles or Rolling Stones? I mean, it''s pretty obviously the Stones, I just want y''all to confirm that for me.

Are you actually nuts? The White Album is a piece of art, nothing the Stones released ever came close.
Dude, Keith Richards literally wrote Satisfaction in his sleep. Mic drop.
Is no one going to point out that the Beach Boys are being left out of this conversation? Pet Sounds is one of the best albums of that decade, Brian Wilson is a genius.
Yea, until he went nuts and became a shut in. Beatles ftw!!
